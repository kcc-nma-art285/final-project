## Deadlines
- 1st Round Draft (Alpha): Due Week 14
- 2nd Round Draft (Beta): Due Week 16
- Complete Final: Due Week 17

## Assignment
Based upon the feedback from your all of your designs, tests, and drafts to date, prepare all of
your final project deliverables and process imagery into a unified presentation that could serve as a portfolio
entry and/or final handoff to the client. There are two key components to the final project:

1. Final Products (final versions of all deliverables)
2. Design Documents (research, sketches, wireframes, conceptual plans, etc.)

As you present each draft (Alpha > Beta > Final), continue to improve upon:

1. the quality of your previous versions for each of your deliverables and 
2. the format and design of your presentation. 

All deliverables should be 100% complete, final products ready to be given to a client.
- If you are creating a interface/web site/mobile app/etc that is coded – the coded site should be
online, fully functioning, and with all final content (ie images, copy, etc).
- If you are creating printed media (ie. business cards, stationary, packaging, etc), you should be
presenting both physical hard copies (ie. printed business card mockups, printed stationary, etc)
and photographed mockups for your portfolio (ie. photos of the business cards on a table, photos of
the packaging/final product, etc). Real custom mockups (that you printed then photograhed) are
ideal, but fake mockups (ie. Photoshopped mockups, templated mockups, etc) are OK.
- If you are creating a time-based piece (ie. motion graphics, video, commercial, etc), the full video
should be posted within the context that it will be seen. For example, if it is a video shown on a web
site, you should create a mockup of the web site with a working link to play the video inside of a
browser.

Some examples of design documents:
- Cleaned-up Sketches
- Color Studies
- Typography Studies
- Site Maps
- Wireframes
- Early Design iterations
- Tests
- Prototypes (both digital and analog)

Lastly, you should consider laying out some (or all) of these out on a table and photographing them for a
stylized presentation. You are not required, but it is recommended, to post “process” images for your final
presentation/portfolio entry, with the primary goal of clearly demonstrating the full creative, conceptual, and
technical design process that you went through over the course of the project. There are multiple ways of
doing this, therefore each student may choose his/her best way to present their final project and process
imagery. Some notable examples include:
- Blog or “Behance” style – a single, long, scrollable vertical web page with a linear (top-to-bottom)
sequence of images
- “Case Study” style - a single, long, scrollable vertical web page with a combination of text and
images that linearly (top-to-bottom) tells the narrative story of the project. [Medium](http://medium.com) is a great place for creative case studies.

## Format

Formats will vary, depending upon the deliverables. In all cases one should be prepared to show the
client the final version(s) for each deliverable and any process images for your portfolio.

For each deliverable: However many are best to show the final product images and whatever format
is best for each deliverable (ie. photographs, mockups, screenshots, etc) and however many process
images (ie. sketches, conceptual planning exercises, etc) are best to demonstrate the creative design process. All products and imagery should be polished, 100% complete and ready to give to the client
for final handoff.

**Post a link to your final project off your main class web page before class begins on each due date.**

## Grading

While the entire course (500 points) is working up to the final project, the final project itself is broken in to 2 phases, worth 100 points each:

**Development**
- 1st Draft: 50 Points
- 2nd Draft: 50 Points
- Total: 100 Points

**Delivery**
- Post Final Project online: 50 points
- Presented at Final Critique: 50 points
- Total: 100 Points

**The development and delivery phase account for 40% of your final grade.**
